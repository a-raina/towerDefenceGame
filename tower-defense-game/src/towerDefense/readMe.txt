Our program is a very simple implementation of a tower defense game. The path is straight rather than having turns.
We only have on type of tower and one type of student (we were anticipating having more). We also wanted to make lasers
that jumped from our towers to the students. However, we were not able to implement them. We also wanted to add circles
that showed each tower's radius but we did not know how to make them transparent. There is a slight bug with our towers
where sometimes only one shoots at a time. Our game is also not the most engaging...

However, everything runs and there are no perceivable errors on our end. We tried to implement a MVP pattern rather than
an MVC (so our presenter does a lot of work).

Despite the hiccups we do think we have the basic structure for creating a more advanced tower defense game.
